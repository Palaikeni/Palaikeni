- 👋 Hi, I’m @Palaikeni
- 👀 I’m interested in a great many things, like the outdoors, sports, videogames, films, craft beers, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning frontend development beginning with HTML and CSS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing for the time being; I have little knowledge and am not currently capable of aiding anyone with contributions.
- 📫 How to reach me: Send me a message here on Github I suppose.
